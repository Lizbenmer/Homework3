#Visually, the graph for participants in group 1 shows that the median is about
#65. Also, we can see that there are two outliers below the minimum value. For 
#group 2, the median seems to be about 68. Meanwhile, there are no outliers. 
#Group 1 is left skewed, this means that participants fall mostly towards the
#values below the median. Thus, for group 2, it is right skewed, so the value 
#for the paricipant mostly goes above the median.

#In this process, the Original data in "TextMessages" was used to obtain summary
#statistics on time (Baseline) by the Group 
by(TextMessages$Baseline, TextMessages$Group,stat.desc)
#When looking at the data, the number of text messages ranges from 47 (min)-85
#(max)for Group 1 and 46(min)-89(max) for Group 2. This corresponds to the mean 
#being 65.60 for Group 2 which is 0.76 greater than Group 1, at 64.80. Thus, the 
#standard deviation for Group 1 and Group 2 are about 10, this means that it is
#about 15% of mean (10/65), so there is moderate variability on the spread of 
#the data. 

#In this process, the Original Data in "TextMessages" was used to obtain summary 
#statistics on time (Six_Months) by the Group 
by(TextMessages$Six_months, TextMessages$Group, stat.desc)

#For the data in Six_Months, the number of text messages ranges from 9(min)-78
#(max) for Group 1 and 46(min)-79 (max) for Group 2. The mean in this data set
#is higher in Group  2 (61.84) in comparison the number of Text messages in 
#Group 1, at 52.96. The difference is 8.88. Hence, the standard deviation for
#Group 1 is about 16, this means that the data for text messages
#is about 30% (16/52.96) of the mean. 30% is a high standard deviation, so it 
#means there is a great variance of text for Six_Months. Furthermore, in Group
#2, the standard deviation is about 9, this means that the data for text 
#messages is about 15% (9/61.84) of the mean. The standard deviation is average
#for Group 2, so moderate variability of data for the data set.


#Overall, the Baseline for Text messages in Group 1 and Group 2, had text
#messages that mostly did fall between the number of 65 (mean). Most participants fell
#in this range. For the Six_Months, there was a great number of variance for the
#data in Group 1. Thus, for Group 2, there was moderate variance because they 
#fell in the range of the mean at 61.
